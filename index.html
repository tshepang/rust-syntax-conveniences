# syntax conveniences afforded by the Rust compiler

Tshepang ~~Lekhonkhobe~~ Mbambo

@tshepang_dev

???

bunch of firsts:
- outside Africa
- software-related conference
- talk

So grateful to whoever took a chance on me to be here,
also because it's been a dream of mine for years to talk to
programming audience,
and it's one of those dreams that feel so distant
(I am a lucky person).

***

There is a constant question about what's the right amount of
convenience.

The answer varies depending on things like experience
(in and outside of Rust).

People can also adapt, but this is also complicated by the desire to
accomodate both new and old users of a tool.

My thought is that "the right amount of convenience" is "something
that makes tedious things less so, without hiding things in a way that
surprises anyone".

This is not what the talk is about... it's more about exploring some
the conveniences by rustc, through the use of examples.

***

I have a fear that somewhere in the slides I got something wrong, and
I would like you to please indicate later on, in any forum or in private.

# about

- I studied electronics formally, but prefer software

- I was a Python fan, and now Rust

- I work at https://panoptix.co.za, which uses Rust in production since 2016

- https://twitter.com/tshepang_dev

???

- enthusiastic boss took a bet on Rust

- not much Rust in Johannesburg, but he looked me up anyways, since I
  was sort of active in the ecosystem

- our meetup hasn't been impressive, but just might, since we are
  moving it to a a place where it may attract more eyes

count: false

## looping

---
class: middle, center
### desired output
```
1
2
3
```

???
let's say we want code that results in this

---
class: middle, left

raw

```rust
let three = [1, 2, 3];
let count = three.len();
let mut index = 0;

loop {
    if index == count {
        break;
    }
    println!("{}", three[index]);
    index += 1;
}
```

???

I have come to like Rust syntax, and think the above look good. But
it's still laborious, and error-prone, and we have convenient syntax
to perform the same thing.



---
class: middle, left

with __while__ keyword, which offers a bit of sugar

```rust
let three = [1, 2, 3];
let count = three.len();
let mut index = 0;

while index < count {
    println!("{}", three[index]);
    index += 1;
}
```

???

... this isn't much of an improvement thugh,
for we just moved the break-out-the-loop decision maker elsewhere

---
class: middle, left

with a trait

```rust
let three = [1, 2, 3];
let mut it = three.iter();

while let Some(member) = it.next() {
    println!("{}", member);
}
```

???

much better

---
class: middle, left

with __for__ keyword, moar sugar

```rust
let three = [1, 2, 3];

for member in three.iter() {
    println!("{}", member);
}
```

---
class: middle, left

addendum, a functional approach (aka who needs __for__ anyways)

```rust
let three = [1, 2, 3];
three.iter().for_each(|member| println!("{}", member));
```

---
class: middle, center
count: false

## range

---
class: middle, center
### desired output
```
1
2
3
```

???

same as last time
---
class: middle, left

there is a type we can use

```rust
for n in std::ops::RangeInclusive::new(1, 3) {
    println!("{}", n);
}

```

???
btw, I so much like inclusive ranges over exclusive one... they are
simply more obvious.

---
class: middle, left

... or we can take advantage of this convenience

```rust
for n in 1..=3 {
    println!("{}", n);
}
```

???
it's weird syntax actually, and I actually preferred the ..., but many
complained that it was not visible enough.

---
class: middle, center
count: false

## method calls

---
class: middle, left

A contrived type

```rust
pub struct MaxThree {
    counter: usize,
}

impl MaxThree {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self { counter: 0 }
    }

    pub fn increase(&mut self) {
        if self.counter < 3 {
            self.counter += 1;
        }
    }

    pub fn current(&self) -> usize {
        self.counter
    }
}
```
---
class: middle, center

### desired output

```plain
loop 0: counter=1
loop 1: counter=2
loop 2: counter=3
loop 3: counter=3
loop 4: counter=3
```

???
On the left is iteration steps

---
class: middle, left

very explicit

```rust
let mut max_three = MaxThree::new();
for n in 0..=4 {
    MaxThree::increase(&mut max_three); // <- look that
    println!(
        "loop {}: counter={:?}",
        n,
        MaxThree::current(&max_three), // <- look that
    );
}
```

---
class: middle, left

with explicit borrows

```rust
let mut max_three = MaxThree::new();
for n in 0..=4 {
    (&mut max_three).increase(); // <- look that
    println!(
        "loop {}: counter={:?}",
        n,
        (&max_three).current(), // <- look that
    );
}
```

---
class: middle, left

then, finally...

```rust
let mut max_three = MaxThree::new();
for n in 0..=4 {
    max_three.increase();
    println!(
        "loop {}: counter={:?}",
        n,
        max_three.current(),
    )
}
```

---
class: middle, center
count: false

## Self shorthand

---
class: middle, left

A contrived type (again)

```rust
struct Number(i32);

impl Number {
    fn increase(self: &mut Self) {
        self.0 += 1;
    }
    fn increase_elided(&mut self) {
        self.0 += 1;
    }
}
```
---
class: middle, left

They behave exactly the same

```rust
let mut number = Number(0);

number.increase();
println!("explicit increment: {}", number.0);

number.increase_elided();
println!("elided increment: {}", number.0);
```

output
```
explicit increment: 1
elided increment: 2
```

---
class: middle, left

the whole list

```rust
self ~-> self: Self
&self ~-> self: &Self
&mut self ~-> self: &mut Self
```

with familiar surroundings
```rust
fn foo(self) ~-> fn foo(self: Self)
fn foo(&self) ~-> fn foo(self: &Self)
fn foo(&mut self) ~-> fn foo(self: &mut Self)
```
---
class: middle, center
count: false

## arithmetic shorthands

---
class: middle, left

before

```rust
let mut foo = 1;
foo = foo + 1;
assert_eq!(foo, 2);
```

after

```rust
let mut foo = 1;
foo += 1; // <- look that
assert_eq!(foo, 2);
```
---
class: middle, left

similarly

```rust
let mut foo = 4;
foo = foo * 4;
assert_eq!(foo, 16);
```

after

```rust
let mut foo = 4;
foo *= 4; // <- look that
assert_eq!(foo, 16);
```

---
class: middle, center
count: false

## question mark operator

---
class: middle, left

before

```rust
let content = match fs::read("/etc/os-release") {
    Ok(content) => content,
    Err(why) => return Err(why),
};
```

after

```rust
let content = fs::read("/etc/os-release")?; // <- look that
```

---
class: middle, left

and now for something nested

```rust
let content_bytes = match fs::read("/etc/motd") {
    Ok(content) => content,
    Err(why) => return Err(why.into()),
};
let content_utf8 = match String::from_utf8(content_bytes) {
    Ok(content) => content,
    Err(why) => return Err(why.into()),
};
```

---
class: middle, left

much better...

```rust
let content = String::from_utf8(fs::read("/etc/motd")?)?;
```

???
You may note that this is contrived, since stdlib got
`fs::read_to_string` method.

## lifetime elision

---
class: middle, left

function call before

```rust
fn not_elided<'a>(value: &'a str) {
    println!("{}", value);
}
```

... and after

```rust
fn elided(value: &str) {
    println!("{}", value);
}
```

???
this is ugly notation, so it's kool that we don't have to specify it
in obvious cases like one shown here

---
class: middle, left

**const**

```rust
const NOISY: &'static str = "some value";
const ELIDED: &str = "some value"
```

**static**

```rust
static NOISY: &'static str = "some value"
static ELIDED: &str = "some value";
```

---
class: middle, center
count: false

## type inference, and coercion

---
class: middle, left

all bare
```rust
let value: Vec<u8> = (1_u8..=3_u8).collect();
```

less type annotating
```rust
let value: Vec<_> = (1_u8..=3_u8).collect();
```

even less annotating
```rust
let value: Vec<_> = (1_u8..=3).collect();
```

you can also just go with fallback int type, `i32`
```rust
let value: Vec<_> = (1..=3).collect();
```
---
class: middle, left

addendum, something surprising
```rust
let mut value: Vec<_> = (1..=3).collect();
assert_eq!(value, [1, 2, 3_u8]);
value.insert(3, 266);
println!("{:?}", value);
```

???
There are probably use-cases where this behavior is desired, and
perhaps this example it too contrived for the surprise in real code

---
class: middle, left

```
[1, 2, 3, 10]
```

---
class: middle, left

There is also...

```rust
let mut explicit: Vec<f32> = Vec::new();
explicit.push(0.1_f32);

let mut inferred = Vec::new();
inferred.push(0.1_f32);
```

We could also just rely on the float fallback, `f64`

```rust
let mut inferred = Vec::new();
inferred.push(0.1);
```

---
class: middle, left

```rust
// very explicit... no inference or coercion
let foo: i64 = 1_64;

// coerced to i8
let foo: i8 = 1;

// inferred to i16
let foo = 1;
assert_eq!(foo, 1_i16);

// inferred to i32, the int fallback
let foo = 1;
assert_eq!(foo, 1);
```

---
class: middle, left

no type annotation (turbofish) needed on `Iter::collect`

```rust
fn to_vec(value: &str) -> Vec<&str> {
    value.split_whitespace().collect()
}

let value = to_vec("1 2 3");
assert_eq!(value, vec!["1", "2", "3"]);
```

... but we could if we wanted
```rust
value.split_whitespace().collect::<Vec<&str>>()
```

## derive

---
class: middle, left

### ~~desired~~ expected output

```rust
Point {
    x: 1,
    y: 2
}
```
(I wish there was a trailing comma, for my eyes)

---
class: middle, left

imagine

```rust
use std::fmt;

struct Point {
    x: isize,
    y: isize,
}

impl fmt::Debug for Point {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        f.debug_struct("Point")
            .field("x", &self.x)
            .field("y", &self.y)
            .finish()
    }
}

let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
println!("{:#?}", point);
```

???
btw when I looked at fmt module, was amazed by the options that it
offers... that stuff so featureful.
---
class: middle, left

more pleasant

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // <- look that
struct Point {
    x: isize,
    y: isize,
}

let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
println!("{:#?}", point);
```

???
This ease also means most people don't need to look at fmt

---
class: middle, center
count: false

## deref coercion

---
class: middle, left

setup

```rust
use std::{
    ffi::OsStr,
    ops::Deref,
    path::{Path, PathBuf},
};

let borrowed = Path::new("some/path.txt");
let owned = PathBuf::from("some/path.txt");
```

---
class: middle, left

we can do all these

```rust
assert_eq!(owned, borrowed);
assert_eq!(&owned, borrowed); // another way to peel avo
assert_eq!(owned, *borrowed); // yet another way to peel avo
```

also

```rust
fn ext(value: &Path) -> Option<&OsStr> {
    value.extension()
}
assert_eq!(ext(&owned), ext(borrowed));
assert_eq!(ext(owned.deref()), ext(borrowed));
assert_eq!(ext(owned.as_path()), ext(borrowed));
assert_eq!(ext(&owned), Some(OsStr::new("txt")));
```

---
class: middle, center
count: false

## if let

---
class: middle, left

```rust
let maybe = (1..3).next();

// before
match maybe {
    Some(value) => println!("{:?}", value),
    None => (),
};

// after
if let Some(value) = maybe {
    println!("{:?}", value);
};
```

---
class: middle, center
count: false

## pretty imports

---
class: middle, left

you could do this

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path;
use std::path::Path;
use std::path::PathBuf;
use std::time::Duration;
```

or this

```rust
use std::{fs, path::{self, Path, PathBuf}, time::Duration};
```

maybe this even
```rust
use std::{
    fs,
    path::{
        self,
        Path,
        PathBuf,
    },
    time::Duration,
};
```

???
you saw example of the last style earlier
